# Welcome to Typed Monads

Monads have a reputation for being difficult to understand, but in this module
 we provide a simple Python implementation of different monadic tools. 
 This will hopefully give some insight into what monads are all about.

## Disclaimer

This is a fork of the original work by  [Correl Roush](http://correl.phoenixinquis.net/)

I added some utility methods to make it easier to use in my day to day code and better interate with the pythonic style ( ie _List Comprehension_ )

Some of the _functional programming_ terms descriptions are taken from Wikipedia.
