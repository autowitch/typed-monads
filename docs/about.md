## Disclaimer

I'm a fan of monads, but believe they work best with the support of a
strong type system. I've attempted to use libraries like
[PyMonad](https://pypi.org/project/PyMonad/), but been frustrated by a
lack of type constraints preventing incorrect usage. I could've
attempted to add type annotations to one of those libraries, but
building my own is more fun.

This is a fork of the original work by  [Correl Roush](http://correl.phoenixinquis.net/)

I added some utility methods to make it easier to use in my day to day code and better interate with the pythonic style ( ie _List Comprehension_ )
